# Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid

# Intuition
We're given the power to insert in any position, which basically means we only need to keep track of the imbalance of brackets and balance when needed.

# Approach
1. keep a running count of open vs closed brackets -> `bal` in my case
2. if balance is ever negative, we should insert an opening bracket to restore balance
3. at the end, if `bal` is non-zero, we need that many closing brackets to restore balance

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Space complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int minAddToMakeValid(string s) {
        int ans{}, bal{};
        for (auto& c : s) {
            bal += (c == '(')? 1 : -1;
            if (bal < 0) {
                ++ans;
                bal = 0;
            }
        }
        return ans + bal;
    }
};
```
