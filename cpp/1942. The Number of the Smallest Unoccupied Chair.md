# Intuition
With a bit of observation, we can see that we need to process the arriving friends by order of earliest arrival. This should hint at sorting or a priority queue.

Additionally, as seats are taken and freed up, we always need to know what the minimum numbered seat is -> again should hint at priority queue.

# Approach
1. push all times to a priority queue
2. update available chairs as each friend arrives
3. assign a chair. if no chair is availble from queue (all `counter` chairs are in use), add `counter + 1`-th chair to queue
4. check return conditions
5. update leaving times

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$
- Space complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestChair(vector<vector<int>>& times, int targetFriend) {
        priority_queue<pair<int,int>, vector<pair<int,int>>, greater<pair<int,int>>> arriving{}, leaving{};
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> avail{};

        // order of processing
        for (int i{}; i < times.size(); ++i) arriving.push({times[i][0], i});
        
        int counter{};
        while (!arriving.empty()) {
            pair<int,int> p = arriving.top();
            arriving.pop();
            int arrive = p.first, leave = times[p.second][1];

            // update chairs according to passed time
            while (!leaving.empty() && leaving.top().first <= arrive) {
                avail.push({leaving.top().second});
                leaving.pop();
            }

            // assign seat
            if (avail.empty()) avail.push(counter++);
            int assigned = avail.top();
            avail.pop();

            // check if is target
            if (p.second == targetFriend) return assigned;
            
            // update leaving times
            leaving.push({leave, assigned});
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
