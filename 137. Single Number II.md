# Intuition

Very smart solution that I saw, just thought I'd write my understanding of this here.

Since every number is guaranteed to appear 3 times, we can utilize a similar property of XOR in that if you `n ^ n = 0`. What this means is that if we create a 3 state counter for each bit, we're able to ensure this kind of behaviour: `n ^ n ^ n` where `^` is our logic for incrementing the 3 state counter.

We can choose our 3 state counter to be the following progression:
`00 -> 01 -> 10 -> 00` for each bit.

Which would be equivalent to this logic (ones is bit 1, twos is bit 2):
```cpp []
ones = (ones ^ n) & ~twos;
twos = (twos ^ n) & ~ones;
```


# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ones{}, twos{};
        for (int& n : nums) {
            ones = (ones ^ n) & ~twos;
            twos = (twos ^ n) & ~ones;
        }
        return ones;
    }
};
```
