# Intuition
Question:
Two strings s1 and s2 are said to be connected if the set of letters of s2 can be obtained from the set of letters of s1 by any one of the following operations:

- Adding exactly one letter to the set of the letters of s1.
- Deleting exactly one letter from the set of the letters of s1.
- Replacing exactly one letter from the set of the letters of s1 with any letter, including itself.

The key here is to realize that we only need to look at one of these cases, say for example "sa" and "ca" could both delete the first letter to get "a" and therefore is connected, which would handle the replacement case. Additionally, adding a letter is the same as deleting a letter from the bigger string.

# Approach
1. Only look at the **deletion** case
2. bitmask to handle sets of letters
3. handle all possible variations of connections of a word in O(26) for each word
4. use hashmap to connect masks to the originating word


# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> groupStrings(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size(), max_members{1}, num_groups{n};
        DisjointSet s(n + 1);
        unordered_map<int, int> mp{}, freq{};
        vector<int> group_size(n, 1), masks(n);

        // calculate masks
        for (int i{}; i < words.size(); ++i) {
            int mask = getMask(words[i]);
            mp[mask] = i;
            
            // deal with duplicates
            num_groups -= freq.count(mask);
            ++freq[mask];
            group_size[i] = freq[mask];
            max_members = max(max_members, group_size[i]);
            masks[i] = mask;
        }

        // union groups
        for (auto& mask : masks) {
            for (int i{}; i < 26; ++i) {
                // only deal with removing letter case
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) == 0) continue;

                // valid connection
                int m = mask & ~(1 << i);
                if (mp.count(m)) {
                    // check union conditions
                    int p1 = s.find(mp[mask]), p2 = s.find(mp[m]);
                    if (p1 == p2) continue;

                    // join
                    int total = group_size[p1] + group_size[p2];
                    s.join(p1, p2);
                    group_size[s.find(p1)] = total;

                    // update answer
                    max_members = max(max_members, total);
                    --num_groups;
                } else {
                    // link valid connection to mask
                    mp[m] = mp[mask];
                }
            }
        }
        
        return {num_groups, max_members};
    }

    int getMask(string& s) {
        int res{};
        for (auto& c : s) {
            res |= 1 << (c - 'a');
        }
        return res;
    }
};
