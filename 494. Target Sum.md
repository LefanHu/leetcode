# Problem

This is another knapsack problem that really helped me understand DP and how to come up with better DP solutions.

# Backtracking (849ms)

Initially, this didn't seem like a knapsack question to me as it required all elements to be dealt with. My first approach was simple and crude:

**Either take the element or not, move on and see if it works**

I quickly realized though that if I happened to be at the same index with the same sum, I'd be doing redundant calculations, which resulted in the next solution with memoization.

```cpp []
class Solution {
    int ans{}, t;
public:
    int findTargetSumWays(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        this->t = target;
        backtrack(nums, 0, 0);
        return ans;
    }

    void backtrack(vector<int>& nums, int indx, int curr) {
        if (curr == t && indx == nums.size()) {
            ++ans;
            return;
        } else if (indx >= nums.size()) {
            return;
        }

        // backtrack
        backtrack(nums, indx + 1, curr + nums[indx]);
        backtrack(nums, indx + 1, curr - nums[indx]);
    }
};
```

# With Memoization (159ms)

Although some may use a 2D matrix for memoization, I figured since the constraints weren't too ridiculous, I could get away with using this simple hash calculation: `hash = (indx << 12) + curr`

```cpp []
class Solution {
    int t;
    unordered_map<int,int> memo{};
public:
    int findTargetSumWays(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        this->t = target;
        int ans = backtrack(nums, 0, 0);
        return ans;
    }

    int backtrack(vector<int>& nums, int indx, int curr) {
        int hash = (indx << 12) + curr;
        if (memo.count(hash)) {
            return memo[hash];
        }

        // check validity
        if (curr == t && indx == nums.size()) {
            return 1;
        } else if (indx >= nums.size()) {
            return 0;
        }

        // backtrack
        int res1 = backtrack(nums, indx + 1, curr + nums[indx]);
        int res2 = backtrack(nums, indx + 1, curr - nums[indx]);

        memo[hash] = res1 + res2;
        return res1 + res2;
    }
};
```

# Bottom Up DP (6ms)

After coming up with the recursive solution, I figured I might as well try the bottom up solution. Initially I didn't really know how to deal with the negatives in a DP matrix of positive indices.

I figured the lazy solution was just to make my DP matrix twice as big :P with an offset.

My `dp[a][b + offset], offset = 2000` represents the number of ways to use the first `a` numbers to create the target sum of `b`.

```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int findTargetSumWays(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int dp[21][4004]{};
        dp[0][0 + 2000] = 1;

        int curr{};
        for (int i{1}; i <= nums.size(); ++i) {
            curr += nums[i - 1];
            for (int j = -curr; j <= curr; ++j) {
                dp[i][j + 2000] = dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1] + 2000] + dp[i - 1][j + nums[i - 1] + 2000];
            }
        }
        return dp[nums.size()][target + 2000];
    }
};
```
